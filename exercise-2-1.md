# Exercise 2.1

Recreate the person data of exercise 1.1 in JavaScript using the [RDF/JS data model](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/)
while taking into account [this OSLO application profile](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/persoon-basis/).
At the end print the RDF to check if it is correct.
